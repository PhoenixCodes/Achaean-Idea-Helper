# Achaean Idea Helper
A small helper package to make the IDEA system more user friendly.

# Syntax
The syntaxes this adds are listed alongside the normal syntaxes in IDEA - seamless integration!

IDEA SHOW NEXT shows you the next idea you have not supported or censured.

IDEA SHOW NEXT ALL shows you the next idea on the list, including ones you have supported or censured

IDEA SHOW LAST shows you the last idea that you viewed.

Clicking an idea from within the IDEA LIST will send IDEA SHOW for that idea. Clicking the +++ or --- where they show up will support or censure that idea, respectively!

# How to use
Simply check your IDEA LIST, and then the new syntaxes will just work.
